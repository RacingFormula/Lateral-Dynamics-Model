# Lateral-Dynamics-Model
## Overview

The Lateral Dynamics Model is an advanced simulation tool designed to analyse the lateral forces acting on a vehicle during cornering. By accounting for factors such as tyre grip, suspension stiffness, and weight distribution, the model provides insights into vehicle stability and handling performance.

## Features

- **Lateral Force Modelling**: Simulates lateral forces based on cornering speeds, tyre grip, and vehicle parameters.
- **Suspension Analysis**: Evaluates the impact of suspension stiffness and damping on lateral stability.
- **Weight Transfer Modelling**: Calculates dynamic weight distribution during cornering.
- **Customisable Inputs**: Supports parameter adjustments for vehicle-specific configurations.
- **Visualisation Tools**: Generates plots for lateral force, weight transfer, and stability metrics.
